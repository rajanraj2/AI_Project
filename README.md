# Closet Companion: Your Fashion Advisor

## Introduction
Welcome to Closet Companion, your personal fashion advisor powered by AI and Machine Learning! This project aims to help you make stylish outfit choices by recommending outfits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 

## Project Overview
Closet Companion classifies clothing items provided by the user into three main categories: T-shirt, Trouser, and Shoes. Additionally, it can identify whether a given T-shirt or Trouser is of light shade or dark in color.

## How to Use
1. **Download the Required Files**: 
    - Access the dataset and saved models from the following link: [Closet Companion Dataset & Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RMxT-2Z1sRG99Cbcj0G7bb17v1hs8Z85?usp=sharing)
    - Download the main file named `model.ipynb`.

2. **Set Up Environment**:
    - Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. Key libraries include TensorFlow, Keras, and numpy.

3. **Run the Model**:
    - Open the `model.ipynb` file in a Jupyter notebook environment or any compatible platform.
    - Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the model.
    
4. **Input Clothing Images**:
    - Provide images of the clothing items you want to classify.
    - The model will classify the clothing into T-shirt, Trouser, or Shoes, and determine if it's light or dark in color.
    
5. **Receive Recommendations**:
    - Based on the classification results, Closet Companion will recommend outfits that match your clothing items.

## Files Overview
- **model.ipynb**: Main file containing the CNN model and code for classification.
- **Dataset**: Contains images used for training and testing the model.
- **Saved Models**: Pre-trained models for quick use.
